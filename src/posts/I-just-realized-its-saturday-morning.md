I just realized it’s saturday morning, 7:12 am. I have headphones with some comfy lo_fi playlist on Spotify to not disturb my neighbors. I live in an Airbnb house which rents four rooms to travelers like me that decided to visit San Cristóbal de las Casas, in Chiapas, Mexico. I am studying and reading about CMS and Gatsby websites, drinking chamomile tea and having sweet bread from a local french bakery.

Again, I just realized that I enjoy this routine so much. I feel healthy, I feel free. Not to mention that my head doesn’t hurt, I've been behaving good I haven't drank since more than 200 days but I am not sure, I stopped counting when I was 150 days without drinking alcohol, and I feel alive.

I am thankful by being alive and having this enlightenment that allows me to enjoy life, to study and to feel good. I was tired of my past life, my lifestyle was really not good and even though I enjoyed it (of course, alcohol makes you feel good) I have to recognize that this lifestyle is much better.

I took my life back, changed bad habits with exercise, long walks, flamenco playing and programming. I cannot get tired of studying, reading, listening to podcasts and wishing the days were longer than 24 hours. I felt proud a couple of days ago when I started dreaming about programming and solving problems, haha.

Although my goal is to find a job at a company and immigrate to Europe, for now I am already working as an independent programmer. I have my own customers and it’s amazing how easy it is to convince other companies to work with you. Once you’re out there, everything just matches. I guess it’s a change in perspective that makes it happen.

Since I was a teenager I started writing, maybe to keep up and not forget about my goals, so that’s why I write these words, to celebrate life and good decisions. Fighting for yourself it’s way much better than destroying yourself every night and complaining about that every morning.

Trust me, it’s not being easy, but it’s possible. If you want something, you have to make it happen, no one will give you things for free. Yes, there are a lot of good people out there willing to help and to provide opportunities, but if you don’t know who you are when chances come, then you’re doomed.

But no worries, today is a new day and today you can start changing your reality. You’re just a bit more wise than yesterday, so wash yourself, have some tasty and greasy breakfast and start your life changing plan, it’s worth the effort, my friend.

I feel naturally happy and this is achieved without using any substances. By the way, being happy doesn’t mean smiling all day long. I also praise the moments of doubt, the dark clouds, it’s all part of this life. Being happy means taking control of your life and watching immediate results. There’s a poem in spanish by Antonio Machado which says “traveler, there is no road, you make your path as you walk”. I hope I found a proper translation to “caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar”.

Cheers from a small quiet town in Mexico.
